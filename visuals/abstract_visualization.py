# Define and abstract visualization class that loads data, parses it correctly,
# and renders the HTML from it.
# All methods should be @abstractmethods with docstrings underneath them that
# tell you what the function should accomplish.
# Look here for an example: https://github.com/chanteriam/reproductive-rights-data-project/blob/main/reproductive_rights_data_project/visualization/abstract_visualization.py
