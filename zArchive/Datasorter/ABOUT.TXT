Quick description for the reasoning behind ./Datasorter's existence

lenss-sensor/servercode/Datasorter/dtatasorter.sh was/is a script for if/when complete and validated sensors send data wirelessly back to GLAS using LoRa and MQQT. The idea is that each sensor has its own identifying number embedded in the data line, so that all of the sensors can simultaneously send data to the Pi, and it can continuously output the stream to a single file. Datasorter.sh then breaks the single file up into each individual sensor based on the identifier string and saves it to its own labeled folder. It also accounts for newly introduced sensors automatically, as it creates a new folder with the appropriate name if none exists. It would make referencing data for individual sensors easier, as they are split up into their appropriate folder. This all assumes that we actually use the initially described collection method, so it was really just an experiment for a possible collection method.
